## 🧠 AI Integration Strategy
We will leverage AI tools to accelerate development and maintain quality:

### 1. Code Generation
- Use AI (e.g., GitHub Copilot / ChatGPT CLI agent) to scaffold boilerplate code (e.g., models, routes, components).  
- Generate repetitive CRUD operations and reduce setup time.  

### 2. Testing
- Use AI prompts to generate **unit tests** and **integration tests** based on function signatures and API contracts.  
- Example: Provide AI with function/class definitions and request complete pytest/Jest test cases.  

### 3. Documentation
- Auto-generate **docstrings** and **inline comments** using AI.  
- Maintain an **up-to-date README.md** with AI help for formatting and clarity.  
- Use AI to summarize commits or pull requests into changelog-ready entries.  

### 4. Context-Aware Techniques
- Feed AI tools with:
  - **API specs** → to generate client code and documentation.  
  - **File trees** → to help AI understand project structure.  
  - **Git diffs** → to suggest improved commit messages, PR descriptions, and targeted tests.
